## AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03): Fundamental Services
### AWS Fundamentals
  - The Building Blocks of AWS: Availability Zones and Regions
    - A Region: have more AZ
    - An AZ: have more data centers
    - Edge locations: endpoint foor caching content, consist of CloudFront (CDN)
      - A networking point of presence that is one of many spread across the globe that is commonly used to cache content.
  - Who Owns What in the Cloud
    - Can you do this yourself in the AWS Management Console?
      - If yes, you are likely responsible
      - If not, AWS is likely responsible
      - Encryption is a shared responsibility
  - Compute, Storage, Databases, and Networking
    - Compute: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
    - Storage: S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway
    - Databases: RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift
    - Networking: VPCs, Direct Connect, Route 53, API Gateway, AWS Global Accelerator
  - What is the Well-Architected Framework?

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  - Securing the Root Account 
  - Controlling Users Actions with IAM Policy Documents
    - Assign Permissions using IAM Policy Documents consiting of JSON
  - Permanent IAM Credentials
    - IAM is Universal
    - IAM Federation

### Vitual Private Cloud (VPC) Networking
  - VPC Overview
    - a virtual data center in the cloud
    - fully customizable network
    - CIDR.xyz
    - consists of internet gateway, route tables, network access controls lists, subnets, and security groups
    - 1 subnet is always in 1 availablity zone

### Elastic Coompute Cloud (EC2)
  - EC2 Overview
    - Pricing Options
      - On-Demand
      - Reserved
      - Spot
      - Dedicated
  - Demo: Launching an EC2 Instance

### Elastic Block Storage（EBS）and Elastic File System (EFS)
  - EBS Overview
    - EBS Volume Types: Solid State Disk 
      - General Purpose SSD
        - gp2
        - gp3
      - Provisioned IOPS SSD
        - io1
        - io2
      - Throughput Optimized HDD
        - st1
      - Cold HDD (sc1)
        - Lowest Cost Option
      - IOPS vs Throughput
        - IOPS: read & write, io1 or io2
        - Throughput: read or write, st1
  - Volumes and Snapshots
    - Volumes exist on EBS, whereas snapshots exist on S3
    - Snapshots are point-in-time photographs of volumes and are incremental in nature.
    - The first snapshot will take some time to create. for consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volumn.
    - You can share snapshots between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region.
    - You can resize EBS volumes on the fly as well as changing the volume types.
  - Protecting EBS Volumes with Encryption
    - Encrypted Volumes
      - Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
      - All data in flight moving tetween the instance and the volume is encrypted
      - All snapshots are encrypted
      - All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted
    - How to Encrypt Volumes
      - Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume
      - Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option
      - Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot
      - Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.
