## AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03): Fundamental Services
### AWS Fundamentals
  - The Building Blocks of AWS: Availability Zones and Regions
    - A Region: have more AZ
    - An AZ: have more data centers
    - Edge locations: endpoint foor caching content, consist of CloudFront (CDN)
      - A networking point of presence that is one of many spread across the globe that is commonly used to cache content.
  - Who Owns What in the Cloud
    - Can you do this yourself in the AWS Management Console?
      - If yes, you are likely responsible
      - If not, AWS is likely responsible
      - Encryption is a shared responsibility
  - Compute, Storage, Databases, and Networking
    - Compute: EC2, Lambda, Elastic Beanstalk
    - Storage: S3, EBS, EFS, FSx, Storage Gateway
    - Databases: RDS, DynamoDB, Redshift
    - Networking: VPCs, Direct Connect, Route 53, API Gateway, AWS Global Accelerator
  - What is the Well-Architected Framework?
    - https://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers
    - Operational Excellence: runing and monitoring systems to deliver business value, and continually improving processes and procedures
    - Performance Efficiency: using IT and computing resources efficiently
    - Security

### Elastic Block Storage（EBS）and Elastic File System (EFS)
  - EBS Overview
    - EBS Volume Types: Solid State Disk 
      - General Purpose SSD
        - gp2
        - gp3
      - Provisioned IOPS SSD
        - io1
        - io2
      - Throughput Optimized HDD
        - st1
      - Cold HDD (sc1)
        - Lowest Cost Option
      - IOPS vs Throughput
        - IOPS: read & write, io1 or io2
        - Throughput: read or write, st1
  - Volumes and Snapshots
    - Volumes exist on EBS, whereas snapshots exist on S3
    - Snapshots are point-in-time photographs of volumes and are incremental in nature.
    - The first snapshot will take some time to create. for consistent snapshots, stop the instance and detach the volumn.
    - You can share snapshots between AWS accounts as well as between regions, but first you need to copy that snapshot to the target region.
    - You can resize EBS volumes on the fly as well as changing the volume types.
  - Protecting EBS Volumes with Encryption
    - Encrypted Volumes
      - Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
      - All data in flight moving tetween the instance and the volume is encrypted
      - All snapshots are encrypted
      - All volumes created from the snapshot are encrypted
    - How to Encrypt Volumes
      - Create a snapshot of the unencrypted root device volume
      - Create a copy of the snapshot and select the encrypt option
      - Create an AMI from the encrypted snapshot
      - Use that AMI to launch new encrypted instances.
  - EC2 Hibernation
  - EFS Overview
  - FSx for Windows
    - fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system
    - FSx for Windows
    - FXx for Lustre
  - Amazon Machine Images: EBS vs. Instance Store
    - An AMI is just a blueprint for an EC2 instance.
    - Instance store volumes are sometimes called ephemeral storage
    - Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data.
    - EBS-backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped.
    - You can reboot both EBS and instance store volumes and you will not lose your data
    - By default, both root volumes will be deleted on termination. However, with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.
